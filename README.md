# Gesture-based-TV-Remote-control

It is a project on GESTURE BASED TV REMOTE CONTROL using Ultrasonic sensor and IR transmitter interfacing with Arduino UNO. For television we are using HEX code but here we are using RGB LED where the all commands will be shown a serial monitor and with different colours on RGB. We can interface with our TV Where swiping over within the specified range in code shows different colours on RGB and different operations if you are using the TV.
